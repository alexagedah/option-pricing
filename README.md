# option-pricing
In this project I explore various methods for pricing vanilla and exotic options taking an object-oriented approach (Full C++ version coming soon!)

# Python
- Black-Scholes-Merton to price European calls and puts on non-dividend paying stocks
- Cox-Ross-Rubinstein to price American calls and puts on non-dividend paying stocks

# To Do
- Calculate the Greeks
- Add graphs which can plot the value of the option as a function of different variables and the greeks as a function of different variables
- Monte Carlo simulation to price Asian options on non-dividend paying stocks (done on internship)
- Trionomial Tree
- Finite difference methods
- C++ Verisions
